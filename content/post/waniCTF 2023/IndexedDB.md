## IndexedDB is a database that is built into a browser, much more powerful than `localStorage`.

-   Stores almost any kind of values by keys, multiple key types.
-   Supports transactions for reliability.
-   Supports key range queries, indexes.
-   Can store much bigger volumes of data than `localStorage`.


***you can view it by using dev tools in your browser
